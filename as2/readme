For Compiling: 

Delete Build folder

mkdir build> cd build > cmake > make 







To run: 

(in the build directory)

./as2

enumarate controls: 

w: move away from cam 
s: move towards cam
a:move left 
d: move right
q: move up 
e: move right 
space: stop moving 

QA: Yes, we can remap the controls to a much more intuitive aproach by mapping the keys to the world axis. This is because the user can untuitively 
recognize that pushing W means go forawrd, and pushing s means go backwards. Thus this implimentation would be possible.
